This is gforth.info, produced by makeinfo version 7.0.3 from
gforth.texi.

This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.9_20241120, November 20, 2024), a
fast and portable implementation of the Standard Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.
